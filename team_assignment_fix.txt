TEAM ASSIGNMENT FIX FOR SCOOTD.C

PURPOSE:
This fix addresses an issue where the scootd.c program doesn't correctly parse 
player checkin types with team designations (such as "loss_promoted:2:A" or "autoup:1:H").
When these designations are present, the player should be assigned to the appropriate team 
(A for AWAY team, H for HOME team).

IMPLEMENTATION:

Locate each team assignment block in the scootd.c file. There are at least two:
- One around line 1042-1054
- One around line 1170-1182

In each location, replace the code that looks like this:

```c
// Assign teams to players without a team assignment
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    if (players[i].team == 0) {
        // Assign to team with fewer players
        if (home_team_count < 4) {
            // If swap is true, reverse the team assignment
            players[i].team = swap ? 2 : 1; // HOME or AWAY based on swap
            home_team_count++;
        } else {
            // If swap is true, reverse the team assignment
            players[i].team = swap ? 1 : 2; // AWAY or HOME based on swap
            away_team_count++;
        }
```

With this code:

```c
// Assign teams to players without a team assignment
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    if (players[i].team == 0) {
        // Parse checkin type for team designation
        const char *type = players[i].checkin_type;
        char team_designation = '\0';
        
        // Find the last ':' character in the type string
        const char *last_colon = strrchr(type, ':');
        if (last_colon != NULL && (last_colon[1] == 'H' || last_colon[1] == 'A')) {
            team_designation = last_colon[1];
        }
        
        // Assign team based on designation (considering swap if enabled)
        if (team_designation == 'H') {
            players[i].team = swap ? 2 : 1; // HOME or swap to AWAY
            home_team_count++;
        } else if (team_designation == 'A') {
            players[i].team = swap ? 1 : 2; // AWAY or swap to HOME
            away_team_count++;
        } else {
            // Default assignment (existing logic) for players without team designation
            if (home_team_count < 4) {
                // If swap is true, reverse the team assignment
                players[i].team = swap ? 2 : 1; // HOME or AWAY based on swap
                home_team_count++;
            } else {
                // If swap is true, reverse the team assignment
                players[i].team = swap ? 1 : 2; // AWAY or HOME based on swap
                away_team_count++;
            }
        }
```

Leave the rest of the function unchanged.

TESTING:
After making these changes, test the program by checking in players with different types:
1. Manual check-ins (with no team designation)
2. Players with "loss_promoted:2:A" type (should go to AWAY team)
3. Players with "autoup:1:H" type (should go to HOME team)

Verify that players are correctly assigned to teams based on their checkin type.
